# Out of Office Web Application

To start, I want to mention that this is a web application. If you want to test or view the final result, you can simply follow this [link](https://out-of-company-client-side.vercel.app) as I have deployed the site on a hosting service. Installing and running it locally is not necessary because it requires .NET 8, ASP.NET, Node.js, and Git to be installed on your computer.

However, if you prefer to run it locally, here are the instructions:

## Running the Project Locally

### 1. Download or Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vichukin/Out_Of_Office.git
cd Out_Of_Office
