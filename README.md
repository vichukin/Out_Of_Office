# Out of Office Web Application

To start, I want to mention that this is a web application. If you want to test or view the final result, you can simply follow this [link](https://red-rock-0b3f6ce0f.5.azurestaticapps.net) as I have deployed the site on a hosting service. Installing and running it locally is not necessary because it requires .NET 8, ASP.NET, Node.js, and Git to be installed on your computer.

However, if you prefer to run it locally, here are the instructions:

## Running the Project Locally

### 1. Download or Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vichukin/Out_Of_Office.git
cd Out_Of_Office
```

### 2. Running the API

- Open the `api` folder in your terminal:
  
  ```bash
  cd Out_of_Office_API
  ```

- Run the API:

  ```bash
  dotnet run
  ```

### 3. Running the Client-Side

- Open a new terminal and navigate to the `client-side` folder:

  ```bash
  cd client-side
  ```

- Install the dependencies:

  ```bash
  npm install
  ```

- Start the development server:

  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```

- Open the link that appears in the terminal to view the application in your browser.

By following these steps, you will be able to run the project locally.
